# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project is very clearly scoped and your user stories show that. In the future, it would be nice
to see evidence of your planning process, like a trello board with current, backlog, and icebox user stories.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. I especially like the 3d CSS! Your JavaScript is simple (and I mean that in the best possible way).

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Really excellent job on the code quality. Your comments make reading the code a breeze, and enjoyable! You
use the jQuery selector often with the same elements. Consider creating variables for the elements you need to work with later in
the program.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Excellent excellent job on this project! I would really like to see you implement the save and share
features you mentioned.
